This is the extraction of _just_ the Barefoot libraries from the T3Tools repo.  They're useful
separate from T3Tools anyway.  Most of them are _really_ old.  Some of them are pretty awful.  They
reflect what was essentially a Perl novice's way of looking at libraries (and a Perl novice from a
C++ background at that), so they don't always do things in a vey Perlish way.  Or a very sane way,
for that matter.  Caveat codor.

But don't use this code.
